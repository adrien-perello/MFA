## Weekly assignment

Instructions:
- Go to `code/`
- Open the `week_2_assignment.ipynb` notebook
- Try to answer all questions – grading will reflect this.
- Save your answer as a **jupyter notebook** (`week_2_assignment_familyName_firstName.ipynb`) or **python script** (`week_2_assignment_familyName_firstName.py`)
- Submit your answers **individually** by the following **Thursday 12:00** on Brightspace.

**Additional notes:**
- Answers will be available after the submission deadline.
- We recommend **individual** work to get the most from this assignment.
- Pairs or threes are ok, but explicitly write who you worked with, so the system doesn’t suspect plagiarism or cheating.
- Some weeks will be individual work, other weeks we’ll have group assignments, to diversify.
