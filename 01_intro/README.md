## Weekly assignment

- Save your answer as a **jupyter notebook** (`week_1_assignment_familyName_firstName.ipynb`) or **python script** (`week_1_assignment_familyName_firstName.py`)
- Submit your answers **individually** by **Wednesday 27/4 16:00** on Brightspace.

**Additional notes:**
- Answers will be available on **Wednesday 27/4** after the submission deadline.
- We recommend **individual** work to get the most from this assignment.
- Pairs or threes are ok, but explicitly write who you worked with, so the system doesn’t suspect plagiarism or cheating.
- Some weeks will be individual work, other weeks we’ll have group assignments, to diversify.
