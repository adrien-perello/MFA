**Additional notes:**
- Answers will be available on **Wednesday XX/XX** after the submission deadline.
- We recommend **individual** work to get the most from this assignment.
- Pairs or threes are ok, but explicitly write who you worked with, so the system doesn’t suspect plagiarism or cheating.
- Some weeks will be individual work, other weeks we’ll have group assignments, to diversify.
